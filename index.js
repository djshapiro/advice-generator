// Start with order-1 questions

// Then do order-1 answers

// Then do order-2 questions

// Then do order-2 answers

// Then do order-n questions

// Then do order-n answers

// Finally, connect answers to questions. Pick a few words in the question and make sure they appear in the answer. Or maybe you could have a separate markov chain that maps questions with word X to answers, like it might alter the selection set of words for the answer. I'll have more insight on this when I get here.
